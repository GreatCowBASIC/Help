This guide provides information that will not only help you get started as a GCBASIC contributor,
but that you wiil find useful to refer to EVEN if you are already an experienced contributor.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Need Help?</strong></span></p><p>The GCBASIC community prides itself on being an open, accessible, and friendly community for new participants.
If you have any difficulties getting involved or finding answers to your questions, please bring those questions to the forum via the discussion boards, where we can help you get started.</p><p>We know EVEN before you start contributing that getting set up to work on GCBASIC and finding a bug that is a good fit for your skills can be a challenge.
We are always looking for ways to improve this process: making GCBASIC more open, accessible, and easier to participate with.
If you are having any trouble following this documentation, or hit a barrier you cannot get around, please contact use via the discussion forum.
We will solve hurdles for new contributors and make GCBASIC better.</p><p>This section addresses developing libraries but this guide is appropriate to any GCBASIC development.</p><p>The section covers the recommended programming style, Constants, Variables, Script syntax (gotchas) and tab usage.</p><p></p><p><span class="strong"><strong>PROGRAMMING STYLES</strong></span></p><p>Indenting is standardized.</p><p>All scripts within a specific library should be the first major section the library.

Scripts supports the &lt;condition&gt; argument that must generate a TRUE result, meaning that at a literal level, your conditional formatting rule is an If - THEN statement along the lines of &#8220;If this condition is TRUE, THEN process the &lt;ACTION&gt;.  the condition must use   logical "AND" and "OR" to test two conditions.
Using "AND" or "OR" reduces the script size, however, it is essential the the conditional test(s) are valid.  If a test fails then  you may not get the results you expect.</p><pre class="screen">        IF .. THEN

Within GCBASIC there are two ways to create constants.&nbsp; &nbsp;
1. with the <code class="literal">#DEFINE</code> instruction, or,
2. via `#SCRIPT .. #ENDSCRIPT'. ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within a script constants can be created and changed.  A script is process that is executed  prior to the GCBASIC source program is processing the main user program.</p><p>An example of using <code class="literal">#DEFINE</code> is</p><pre class="screen">        #DEFINE TIME_DELAY_VALUE    10</pre><p>The script construct is</p><pre class="screen">        #SCRIPT

The variables are NOT available as variables to a user program or a library beyond the scope of the script.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The variables are available  to a user program as constants.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The variables will be integer values, if accessed in a user program.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>SCRIPT SYNTAX</strong></span></p><p>Scripting support the preprocessing of the program to create specific constants.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Many libraries have script to create constants to support PWM, Serial, HEFSAF etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>You can use the limited script language to complete calculations using real numbers but you MUST ensure the resulting constant is an integer value.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Use the IN() method to ensure an integer is assigned.</p><p>You can use IF-THEN-ENDIF but if your IF condtional test uses a chip regiseter or a user define constant then you must ensure the register or constant exists.&nbsp;&nbsp;
If you do not check the registrer or constant exists the script will fail to operate as expected.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>There is limted syntax checking.
