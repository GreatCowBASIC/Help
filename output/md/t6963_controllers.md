This section covers Graphical Liquid Crystal Display (GLCD) devices that
use the Toshiba T6963 graphics controller.   The T6963 is a monochrome
device that typically is blue or white.   The GLCD can be provided in a
number of pixels sizes - 240 \* 64 or 240 \* 128.  
  
The Toshiba T6963 is a very popular LCD controller for use in small
graphics modules. It is capable of controlling displays with a
resolution up to 240x128. Because of its low power and small outline it
is most suitable for mobile applications such as PDAs, MP3 players or
mobile measurement equipment.  
  
A number of GLCD modules have this controller built-in these include the
SP12N002 & SP14N001. Although this controller is small, it has the
capability of displaying and merging text and graphics and it manages
all the interfacing signals to the displays Row and Column
drivers.   The GCBASIC library supports the complex capabilities of the
T6963.  
  
The T6963 is an LCD is driven by on-board 5V parallel interface chipset
T6963.   For the specific operating voltage always verify the operating
voltages in the device specific datasheet.  
  
The GCBASIC connectivity option is the 8-bit mode - where 8 connections
(for the data) are required between the microcontroller and the GLCD to
control the data bus.  
  
To use the T6963 driver simply include the following in your user code.
   This will initialise the driver.

The T6963 differs from most other GLCD controllers in its use of the
display RAM.    Where a fixed area of memory is normally allocated for
text, graphics and the external character generator, but with the T6963
the size for each area <span class="strong">**MUST**</span> be set by
software commands.    This means that the area for text, graphics and
external character generator can be freely allocated within the external
memory, up to 64 kByte.   Check the specific device for the amount of
memory available.   This can range from 4 kbyte to 64 kbyte.

  
  
For more information on memory management refer the device specific
datasheet.  
  
The GCBASIC constants control the memory configuration of the T6963
controller.

The GCBASIC library supports the following capabilities.   Please refer
to the relevant Help section and the device specific demonstrations.  
  
<span class="strong">**Commands Supported for the LCD and
GLCD**</span>  
  

The GLCD command set covers the standard GLCDCLS, Line, Circle and all
the GLCD methods and the LCD command set: CLS, Locate, Print, LCDHEX
etc. The demonstrations show how to load BMP loading via external data
sources and GLCD and LCD page swapping.  
  
The table below shows the specific implementations of the command set
for this device.   Refer to the GLCD and LCD in the Help for the generic
GLCD and LCD commands.

<span class="strong">**GLCD and LCD page swapping**</span>  
  
To support GLCD and LCD page swapping - this can be used to support
fixed pages of information, BMPs or scrolling the following constants
have are available to the user.  
  

For GLCD memory addressing

``` screen
  GLCDPage0_T6963
  GLCDPage1_T6963
  GLCDPage2_T6963
  ... etc
  GLCDPage10_T6963
```

Ten pages are automatically created but the number of pages available is
constrained by the memory configuration.  
  
For LCD memory addressing

``` screen
  LCDPage0_T6963
  LCDPage1_T6963
  LCDPage2_T6963
  ...etc
  LCDPage10_T6963
```

Ten pages are automatically created but the number of pages available is
constrained by the memory configuration.  
To use add the following to you user program.   See the demonstration
programs for more detailed usage.   After calling the `SelectGLCDPage`
or `SelectLCDPage` methods all GLCD or LCD commands will be applied to
the current GLCD or LCD page.  
  

``` screen
    'Select the GLCD page 1 memory
    SelectGLCDPage ( GLCDPage1_T6963 )

    'Select the LCD page 2 memory
    SelectLCDPage ( LCDPage2_T6963 )
```

  
  

The `SelectLCDPage` and `SelectLCDPage` and "Set Text Home Address"
methods change the screen being viewed on the device.

The key is to establish what you want your memory map to look like.    
Below is a map for one of my 240 x 64 pixel device.     The default is
for 10 screen pages (some newer LCD’s may have more RAM for more
screens).     If you write the appropriate value (0x1000, or 0x11b0, or
0x1360, etc) to the text home address, the display will instantly change
to that screen - using `SelectLCDPage` and `SelectLCDPage` method with
the appropiate constant as parameter.

You can write your screens "ahead of time", in my case during the
"splash screen" delay interval, and instantly change to them later as
desired.     You can do this by setting <span
class="strong">**current\_grh\_home\_addr**</span> to the appropiate
page.    And, then execute the GLCD commands you would normal use.

The graphic and text screens are independant but can be overlaid for a
variety of useful effects.

Although, not tested, the LCD text screens can be scrolled 1 full text
line at a time, while the GLCD screens can be scrolled 1 pixel row at a
time, provided you’ve set up your memory map accordingly with adequate
RAM for the graphic area.
