The name of the file is specified in between &lt; and &gt; symbols. For instance, to include the file <code class="literal">srf04.h</code>, the directive is:</p><pre class="screen">    #include &lt;srf04.h&gt;</pre><p>Relative is used to read files in the same folder as the currently selected program. Filenames are given enclosed in quotation marks, such as where <code class="literal">mycode.h</code> is the name of the file that is to be read.</p><pre class="screen">    #include "mycode.h"</pre><p><span class="strong"><strong>NOTES:</strong></span>
It is not essential that the include file name ends in .h - the important thing is that the name given to GCBASIC is the exact name of the file to be included.</p><p>Those who are familiar with <code class="literal">#include</code> in assembly or C should bear in mind that <code class="literal">#include</code> in GCBASIC works differently to <code class="literal">#include</code> in most other languages - code is not inserted at the location of the <code class="literal">#include</code>, but rather at the end of the current program.</p></div></body></html>
