<span class="strong">**Syntax:**</span>

``` screen
    OutputVariable = Peek (location)
```

<span class="strong">**Command Availability:**</span>

Available on all microcontrollers.

<span class="strong">**Explanation:**</span>

The `Peek` function is used to read information from the on-chip RAM of
the microcontroller.

`location` is a word variable that gives the address to read. The exact
range of valid values varies from chip to chip.

This command should not normally be used, as it will make the porting of
code to another chip very difficult.

<span class="strong">**Example \#1 :**</span>

``` screen
    'This program will read and check a value from PORTA
    'This specific peek will only work on some microcontrollers
    Temp = Peek(5)
    IF Temp.2 ON THEN SET green ON
IF Temp.2 OFF THEN SET red ON
```

<span class="strong">**Example \#2**</span>

``` screen
    ' This subroutine will toggle the pin state.
    ' You must change the parameters for your specific chip.
    ' Usage as show in examples below.
    '
    '      Toggle @PORTE, 2 ' equates to RE1.
    '      Wait 100  ms
    '      Toggle @PORTE, 2
    '      Wait 100 ms


    ' Port , Pin address in Binary
    ' Pin0 = 1
    ' Pin1 = 2
    ' Pin2 = 4
    ' Pin3 = 8
    '
    ' You can toggle any number of pins.
    ' Toggle @PORTE, 0x55
    Sub Toggle ( In DestPort As word, In DestBit )
          Poke DestPort, Peek(DestPort) xor DestBit
    End sub
```
