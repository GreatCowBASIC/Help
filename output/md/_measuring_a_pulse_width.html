The guide provides guidance on measuring a pulse width using Timer 1 and the CCP module.  This guidance was used as the basis for the GCBASIC port the shown below.  The guidance was generic and in this example polling the CCP flag bit was more convenient than using an interrupt.</p><p>In this demonstration shown below, a 16F1829 microcontroller operating at 32 Mhz uses the internal oscillator. The demonstration code is based on a macro that uses Timer1 and CCP4. However, any of the four CCP modules could be used, the 16F1829 microcontroller has four CCP module.</p><p>The timer resolution of this method uses a timer Prescaler of 1:8 and a microcontroller frequency of 32 MHz giving a pulse width resolution is 1ms.  With the timer Prescaler of 1:2 and the microcontroller frequency of 32MHz the resolution is 250 ns.</p><p>The accuracy is dependent upon the accuracy of the system clock, but oscilliscope measurements have show an accuracy of +- 1us from 3us to 1000us.</p><p>In this demonstration the following was implemented</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">Using GCBASIC a macro to ensure the generated assembler is inline to ensure the timing is consistent and no sub routines are called.</li><li class="listitem">Another microcontroller was used to generate the pulses to be measured</li><li class="listitem">A TEK THS730A oscilliscope was used to measure/verify pulse widths</li><li class="listitem">A 4x20 LDC module with an I2C Backpack was used to display the results.

pulse was detected or the pulse was longer than allowed by the prescaler/OSC settings. In this case, return a value of zero for pulse width.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Usage:</strong></span></p><p>To get positive pulse width use:</p><pre class="screen">    PULSE_IN</pre><p><code class="literal">PULSE_IN</code> returns a global word variable Pulse_Width</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Demonstration Program:</strong></span></p><pre class="screen">    #Chip 16F1829, 32
