<br></p><p><span class="strong"><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></span></p><p>The compiler was created by Dr. Hugh Considine when he was 12 years old.&nbsp;&nbsp;That was in 2005.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hugh came up with the idea for a new compiler - of the then available compilers - they were hard to use and not free. &nbsp;&nbsp;And, he had some spare time.</p><p>Hugh believes that GCBASIC should be free to all - forever.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The original software was called Great Cow BASIC, but, he had some resistance in getting high schools in Australia to use and agree to the use of text based programming.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Graphical GCBASIC was created to address the need for a graphical user interface.&nbsp;&nbsp;Graphical GCBASIC acts like a set of training wheels. &nbsp;&nbsp;
The concept of Graphical GCBASIC is that the icons make it less scary, and since they all share names with the BASIC commands it is then easy to remember what command corresponds to each icon..&nbsp;&nbsp;
Using Graphical GCBASIC users can then switch to text mode whenever they want to, go backwards and forwards a few times if they want, and finally end up using just the text programming.&nbsp;&nbsp;
It is a journey from a graphical user interface to text based programming.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<br>
Those who already have programming experience can go straight to GCBASIC, while those who would prefer a lighter learning curve can take the Graphical GCBASIC option. &nbsp;&nbsp;
The two approaches targets two different sets of users who ultimately want to do the same thing.
<br>
<br>
As for the <span class="strong"><strong>name</strong></span>, it was the fourth name Hugh tried. &nbsp;&nbsp;First name was BASPIC, but it did not seem memorable enough.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Then, he considered some animal names - first thought was Chipmunk BASIC, but someone already used that!&nbsp;&nbsp;
Then, Bear BASIC, but decided against it on finding out the slang meaning of bear.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Final  name was GCBASIC, which is named after something his sister and he came up with (when aged 12 and 15!!).&nbsp;&nbsp;
No-one else had that name, it had no meanings that could offend, and it was something odd enough to be memorable, so Great CoW CBASIC it was.</p><p>In 2013 Evan Venn joined the team as a compiler developer, with others joining in Bernd Dau, Trevor Roydhouse, Pete Everett, Theo Loermans, Giuseppe D&#8217;Elia, Derek Gore,  Ian Smith, Bernd Dau, Theo Loermans, Urs Hopp, Kent Schafer, and Frank Steinberg.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Some those that joined in drove changes to the compiler, some changed the source code, some built tools and some built libraries.&nbsp;&nbsp;
They all had one thing in common - improvements to the GCBASIC compiler.</p><p>In 2021 we are still having new developers join the project like ToniG adding a new capability for handling Tables.</p><p>In 2023 we renamed to GCBASIC.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cow is now deadbeef &#8230;&#8203; a hex number .. :-).</p><p><br>
<br></p><p><span class="strong"><strong>THE COMPILER</strong></span></p><p>The compiler executable is called GCBASIC.EXE. &nbsp;&nbsp;
The compiler source is written in FreeBASIC.&nbsp;&nbsp;
FreeBASIC is a multiplatform, free/open source (GPL) BASIC programming language and a compiler for Microsoft Windows, protected-mode MS-DOS (DOS extender), Linux and FreeBSD.
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<br>
The official website is <a class="link" href="https://www.freebasic.net/" target="_top">https://www.freebasic.net/</a>
<br>
<br>
FreeBASIC provides syntax compatibility with programs originally written in Microsoft QuickBASIC (QB).&nbsp;&nbsp;
FreeBASIC is a command line only compiler, unless users manually install an external integrated development environment (IDE) of their choice.&nbsp;&nbsp;
IDEs specifically made for FreeBASIC include FBide and FbEdit, while more graphical options include WinFBE Suite and VisualFBEditor.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<br>
The source code is Open Source.&nbsp;&nbsp;
And, has a GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<br>
The source code for the compiler can be found on <a class="link" href="https://sourceforge.net/p/gcbasic/code/HEAD/tree/GCBASIC/trunk/" target="_top">SourceForge</a>
<br>
<br>
Use SVN to UPDATE and COMMIT code changes.&nbsp;&nbsp;
You require developer access to SourceForge but if you have got this far then you already know this.&nbsp;&nbsp;
You are therefore  required to use SVN for source code management.</p><p>When COMMITting you MUST update the change log, then, when you commit an update use the change log with the SourceForge commit number.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Then, add the new change at the end of the change log.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The COMMIT message should be the same as the description in the change log.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Add the [<span class="emphasis"><em>COMMIT NUMBER]</em></span> to the description in the change log to show the COMMIT number.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>You will find the changelog <a class="link" href="https://onedrive.live.com/Edit.aspx?resid=2F87FFE77F3DBEC7!67634&amp;wd=cpe&amp;authkey=!ADmkT3exl5l4Pkc" target="_top">here</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The change log is an EXCEL spreadsheet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br>
<br></p><p><span class="strong"><strong>COMPILER ARCHITECTURE</strong></span></p><p>The compiler is relatively simple in terms of the architecture.&nbsp;&nbsp;
There is a main source program with a set of header files that contain other methods or declarations.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The GCBASIC header files are the following:</p><pre class="screen">    1. preprocessor.bi -  methods, statements, defines, declarations, prototypes, constants, enumerations, or similar types of statements
    2. utils.bi - methods that are shared across the architecture
    3. variables.bi - methods that control the creation and management of variables
    4. assembly.bi - methods specific to the generation of GCAssembler (GCASM)
    5. file.bi - the FreeBASIC files library
    6. string.bi - the FreeBASIC string library</pre><p>The supporting files are:</p><pre class="screen">    1. messages.dat - the English messages source file.  All user messages from the compiler are sourced from this file.
    2. reservedwords.dat - the list of system reserved words</pre><p><br>
<br>
The compiler process is simple.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The process, shown below, generates the ASM source and the HEX file from the user source program.</p><pre class="screen">    1. Create the indexes
    2. Declare the methods, arrays and variables
    3. Process the user source programs using PreProcessor method. This includes
        i.     Loading of all source files including including files
        ii.    Translate files, if needed
        iii.   Examine source for comments, tables, asm, rawasm, functions;subs;macros, set origin of valid code
                    Origin = ";?F" + Str(RF) + "L" + Str(LC) + "S" + Str(SBC) + "?"
                    RF = File number
                    L  = Line number in source file
                    S  = Sub Routine number
        iv.    Find compiler directives, except SCRIPT, ENDSCRIPT, IFDEF and ENDIF - including all the #DEFINEs outside of condiontal statements
        v.     If GLCD_TYPE in user source program is found, then, determine the library and load that library with all dependent libraries. This method improves compiler performance by only loading the required libraries
        vi.    ReadChipData
        vii.   CheckClockSpeed
        viii.  ReadOptions
        ix.    PreparePageData
        x.     PrepareBuiltIn.  Initialise built-in data, and prepare built-in subs.
        xi.    RunScripts
        xii.   BuildMemoryMap
        xiii.  Process samevar and samebit
        xiv.   RemIfDefs.  Remove any #IFDEFs that do not apply to the program.
        xv.    Prepare programmer, need to know chip model and need to do this before checking config
        xvi.   Replace Constants
        xvii.  Replace table value.  Replace constants and calculations in tables with actual values
    4. Compile the program using the CompileProgram method
         i.    Compile calls to other subroutines, insert macros
         ii.   Compile DIMs again, in case any come through from macros
         iii.  Compile FOR commands
         iv.   Process arrays
         v.    Add system variable(s) and bit(s)
         vi.   Compile Tables
         vii.  Compile Pot
         viii. Compile Do
         ix.   Compile Dir
         x.    Compile Wait
         xi.   Compile On Interrupt
         xii.  Compile Set(s)
         xiii. Compile Rotate
         xiv.  Compile Repeat
         xv.   Compile Select
         xvi.  Compile Return
         xvii. Compile If(s)
         xviii Compile Exit Sub
         xix.  Compile Goto(s)
    5. Allocate RAM using the AllocateRAM method
    6. Optimise the generated code using the TidyProgram method
    7. Combine and locate the subroutines and functions for the selected chip using the MergeSubroutines method
    8. Complete the final optimisation using the FinalOptimise method
    9. Write the assembly using the WriteAssembly method
    10. Assemble and generate the hex file using GCASM, MPASM, PICAS or some other define Assembler
    11. Optionally, pass programming operations to the programmer
    12. Write compilation report using the WriteCompilationReport method
    13. If needed, write the error and warning log using the WriteErrorLog method
    14. Exit, setting the ERRORLEVEL</pre><p>Note #1:  Constants are can be created in many places and the order is critical when trying to understant the process.</p><p>Step 3.iv; Step 3.xi, 3.xiv and xvi. These are Find compiler directives; Runscripts, process IFDEFs and replace Constants values respectively.&nbsp;&nbsp;
This means constants that are not created by the Find compiler directives step are clearly not available in the RunScripts step, and the same applies to the process IFDEFs step.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, please consider the order of constant creation in terms of these steps.&nbsp;&nbsp;Always think about the precendence of constant creation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Note #2:  When using IFDEFs Conditional statements you should #UNDEFINE all constants prior to #DEFINE.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst the will be cases where the constant does not exist, or where the Preprocessor can determine the outcome of the Conditional statements there will be cases, specifically nested IFDEFs Conditional statements, where you will be required to use #UNDEFINE to remove all warnings.</p><p>Note #3:  Good practice is NOT to create constants in a library where the user can overwrite the value of the same constant.&nbsp;&nbsp;You must determine if the user has created the constant and then create a default value if the user has not defined a value.&nbsp;&nbsp;  An example:</p><pre class="screen">  IF NODEF(AD_DELAY) THEN
     'Acquisition time. Can be reduced in some circumstances - see PIC manual for details
     AD_DELAY = 2 10US
  END IF</pre><p>This will create the constant AD_DELAY only when the user program does not define a value.

You must forgive him for being a genius, but, he did not implement many programming styles and conventions that are common place today.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>There is a general lack of documentation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

    2. Do not use TAB - use two spaces
    3. You can rename a variable to a meaningful name.  Hugh used a lot of single character variables many years ago.  This should be avoided in new code.
    4. Document as you progress.
