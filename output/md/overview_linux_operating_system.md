<span class="strong">**Introduction:**</span> GCBASIC can be used when
using the Linux Operating System.

This instructions are not distribution specific, but are for Linux only
(not Windows).

<span class="strong">**Instructions:**</span> Complete the following
steps to compile and install GCBASIC for Linux:

<div class="orderedlist">

1.  Install FreeBasic from your distributions repository or
    <http://www.freebasic.net/wiki/CompilerInstalling>
2.  Download the "GCBASIC - Linux Distribution" from SourceForge at
    <https://sourceforge.net/projects/gcbasic/files/>
3.  Unrar/unpack GCBASIC.rar to a location of your choice within your
    home directory (eg. within Downloads) with either a file manager or
    from a console.
4.  From a console, change to the GCBASIC Sources in the unpacked
    directory:

</div>

``` screen
   eg. cd ~/Downloads/sources/linuxbuild/
```

<div class="orderedlist">

1.  Make sure that `install.sh` is set as executable (ie.
    `chmod +x install.sh`), and then execute: ./install.sh build
2.  You will need root privileges for this step. You can switch user
    (su) to root, or optionally use `sudo`.

</div>

``` screen
   Execute: [sudo] ./install.sh install
```

<div class="orderedlist">

1.  If you suâ€™d to root, use `exit` to drop back to your normal user.
    Then, be sure to follow the instructions given by the script for
    updating your path.
2.  Confirm proper execution, and the version, of GCBASIC by executing:
    gcbasic /version

</div>

Now you can create and compile GCBASIC source files.

<span class="strong">**Programming microcontrollers:**</span>

To program your microcontroller with your GCBASIC created hex file, you
will need additional programming and programmer software.

For Microchip PIC microcontroller programming, you might find what you
need at: www.pickitplus.co.uk The PICKitPlus Team provide programmers
and Linux software.

For Atmel AVR microcontroller programming, you will need `avrdude`. It
should be available in your distributions repository. If not, check
here: <http://www.nongnu.org/avrdude/>
