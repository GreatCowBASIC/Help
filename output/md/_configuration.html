Atmel AVR microcontrollers
do have a similar configuration settings, but they are controlled
through "Configuration Fuses". GCBASIC cannot set these -
you MUST use the programmer software.)</em></span></p><p>Every Microchip PIC has a CONFIG word. This is an area of memory on the chip
that stores settings which govern the operation of the chip.</p><p>The following asects of the chip are governed by the CONFIG word:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">Oscillator selection - will the chip run from an internal oscillator,
or is an external one attached?</li><li class="listitem">Automatic resets - should the chip reset if the power drops too low?
If it detects it is running the same piece of code over and over?</li><li class="listitem">Code protection - what areas of memory must be kept hidden once
written to?</li><li class="listitem">Pin usage - which pins are available for programming, resetting the
chip, or emitting PWM signals?</li></ul></div><p>The exact configuration settings vary amongst chips. To find out a list
of valid settings, please consult the datasheet for the microcontrollers that
you wish to use.</p><p>This can all be rather confusing - hence, GCBASIC will automatically set
some config settings, unless told otherwise:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Low Voltage Programming (LVP) is turned off.</strong></span> This enables the PGM
pin (usually B3 or B4) to be used as a normal I/O pin.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Watchdog Timer (WDT) is turned off.</strong></span> The WDT resets the chip if it
runs the same piece of code over and over - this can cause trouble with
some of the longer delay routines in GCBASIC.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Master Clear (MCLR) is disabled where possible.</strong></span> On many newer chips
this allows the MCLR pin (often PORTA.5) to be used as a standard input
port. It also removes the need for a pull-up resistor on the MCLR pin.</li><li class="listitem"><p class="simpara"><span class="strong"><strong>An oscillator mode will be selected, based on the following rules:</strong></span></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: circle; "><li class="listitem">If the microcontroller has an internal oscillator, and the internal oscillator is
capable of generating the speed specified in the #chip line, then the
internal oscillator will be used.</li><li class="listitem">If the clock speed is over 4 Mhz, the external HS oscillator is
selected</li><li class="listitem">If the clock speed is 4 MHz or less, then the external XT oscillator
mode is selected.</li></ul></div></li></ul></div><p>Note that these settings can easily be individually overridden whenever
needed. For example, if the Watchdog Timer is needed, adding the line</p><pre class="screen">    #config WDT = ON</pre><p>This will enable the watchdog timer, without affecting any other
configuration settings.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Using Configuration</strong></span></p><p>Once the necessary CONFIG options have been determined, adding them to
the program is easy. On a new line type "#config" and then list the
desired options separated by commas, such as in this line:</p><pre class="screen">    #config OSC = RC, BODEN = OFF</pre><p>GCBASIC also supports this format on 10/12/16 series chips:</p><pre class="screen">    #config INTOSC_OSC_NOCLKOUT, BODEN_OFF</pre><p>However, for upwards compatibility with 18F chips, you should use the = style config settings.</p><p>It is possible to have several #config lines in a program - for
instance, one in the main program, and one in each of several #include
files. However, care must then be taken to ensure that the settings in
one file do not conflict with those in another.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>For more help, see</strong></span> <a class="link" href="__config.html" title="#config">#config Directive</a></p></div></body></html>
