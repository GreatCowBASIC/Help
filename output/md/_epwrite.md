<span class="strong">**Syntax:**</span>

``` screen
    EPWrite location, data
```

<span class="strong">**Command Availability:**</span>

Available on all Microchip PIC and Atmel AVR microcontrollers with
EEPROM data memory.

<span class="strong">**Explanation:**</span>

`EPWrite` is used to write information to the EEPROM data storage, so
that it can be accessed later by a programmer on the PC, or by the
`EPRead` command. `location` represents the location to write data to,
and the location varies from one chip to another. `data` is the data
that is to be written to the EEPROM, and can be a value or a variable.

### Note

Do not exceed the location ( also known as the EEProm address ) of the
physical EEProm.  If the EEProm size is 256 ensure location is in the
range of 0 to 255;  If the EEProm size is 512 ensure location is in the
range of 0 to 511 and use a Word variable as the location parameter.

<span class="strong">**Example:**</span>

``` screen
    #chip 16F819, 8

    'Set the input pin direction
    Dir PORTA.0 In

    'Loop to take readings until the EEPROM is full
    For CurrentAddress = 0 to 255

    'Take a reading and log it
    EPWrite CurrentAddress, ReadAD(AN0)

    'Wait 10 minutes before getting another reading
    Wait 10 min

    Next
```
