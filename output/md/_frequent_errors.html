<br>
<br>
<span class="red">No oscillator:</span>  Keep in mind that, besides the frequency, you must also set the type of oscillator, internal or external.
<br>
<br>
<span class="red">No GCBASIC frequency stated:</span> If not declared in your source program - GCBASIC uses a preset frequency suitable for operating the microcontroller as the fastest practical.
<br>
<br>
<span class="red">External oscillators:</span> It must be explicitly stated, if not stated GCBASIC  will attempt to setup the internal oscillator.
<br>
<br>
<span class="red">Ports:</span> GCBASIC will set the ports automatically but you may need to set the ports outputs or inputs when needed.
<br>
<br>
<span class="red">Analog levels:</span>  When applied on the ports defined as digital inputs. can cause current consumption in the input buffer, which is outside the device specifications. Beware.
<br>
<br>
<span class="red">Current drawn:</span> Current taken from the microcontroller outputs, exceeding the maximum allowed (not all pins supply the same current).  Beware of drawing to much current.
<br>
<br>
<span class="red">Watchdog Timer (WDT):</span> The WDT is a useful timer.  Enable to reset the microcontroller when processing can get stuck in a loop.
<br>
<br>
<span class="red">Interrupts:</span> A badly controlled interrupt (in some cases) will prevent the execution of the entire program.
<br>
<br>
<span class="red">No action:</span> The circuit is not powered.
<br>
<br>
<span class="red">Still no action:</span> The microcontroller is not present or different from the device you expected.
<br>
<br>
<span class="red">Still no action:</span> The microcontroller inserted incorrectly in the appropriate socket.
<br>
<br>
<span class="red">Cannot program:</span> Incorrect programmer, Incorrect programmer parameters or circuit connections are incorrect.
<br>
<br>
<span class="red">Still Cannot program:</span> Values of excessively incorrect circuit resistances.
<br>
<br>
<span class="red">Serial Communcations:</span> The TX and RX pins of the serial port are exchanged, and/or the connections with the level converter, ttl / rs232 or ttl / usb.
<br>
<br>
<span class="red">Stlll no Serial Communcations:</span> Serial speed, different from the one set in the circuit with which it is intended to communicate or vice versa.
<br>
<br>
<span class="red">No I2C/TWI:</span>  SDL and/or SCL pin exchanged on the I2C/TWI bus connection, and/or no pull-up resistors, and/or no common 0 voltage.
<br>
<br>
<span class="red">Incorrect timing:</span> Calculation of any timings related to the frequency of the external oscillator, without taking into account the division by 4.
<br>
<br>
<span class="red">Strange Numeric Values:</span> The variables declared are insufficient to contain the values &#8203;&#8203;to be processed.
