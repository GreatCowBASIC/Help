Explanatory notes embedded within the code.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Comments are used to remind yourself and to inform others about the function of your program.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Comments are ignored by the compiler</p><p>You can comment out sections of code if you want just by placing an apostrophe at
the beginning of each line. The SynGCB IDE has a feature to do this automatically.
<br>
<br>
You can also use a REM (for REMark statement), a semi-colon or two forward slashes.
<br>
<br>
Multiline comments are support for large text descriptions of code or to comment out chunks of code while debugging applications.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Syntax:</strong></span></p><pre class="screen">    /*
      block comment
    */</pre><p>Warning: Graphical GCBASIC uses semi-colons to mark comments that it has
inserted automatically. It does not read these comments when opening a file, so any
comments in a GCBASIC program starting with a semi-colon will be deleted if the
program is opened using Graphical GCBASIC.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Example:</strong></span></p><pre class="screen">    ' The number of pins to flash
    #define FlashPins 2

    REM You can create a header using an apostrophe before each line
    REM This is a great way to describe your program
    REM You can also use it to describe the hardware connections.

    ' You can place comments above the command or on the same line
    Dir PORTB Out ' Initialise PORTB to all Outputs

    ; The Main loop
    do
    PORTB = 0 ' All Pins off
    Wait 1 S ' Delay 1 second
    PORTB = 0xFF ' All pins on
    Wait 1 s ' Delay 1 second
    Loop</pre></div></body></html>
