    HPWM channel, frequency, duty cycle, timer [, resolution]
```

<span class="strong">**Command Availability:**</span>

<span class="strong">**Only**</span> available on Microchip PIC
microcontrollers with the 10-bit PWM module.

For the Capture/Compare/PWM (CCP) module, see here
<a href="_hpwm_ccp.html" class="link" title="HPWM CCP">HPWM CCP</a>

<span class="strong">**Explanation:**</span>

This command sets up the hardware PWM module of the Microchip PIC
microcontroller to generate a PWM waveform of the given frequency and
duty cycle. Once this command is called, the PWM will be emitted until
PWMOff is called.

`channel` is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8. These corresponds to the HPWM1
through to HPWM8 respectively.  
The 10-bit PWM channel <span class="strong">**MUST**</span> be supported
by the microcontroller. Check the microcontroller specific datasheet for
the available channel.

`frequency` sets the frequency of the PWM output. It is measured in KHz.
The maximum value allowed is 255 KHz. The minimum value varies depending
on the clock speed. 1 KHz is the minimum on chips 16 MHz or under and 2
Khz is the lowest possible on 20 MHz chips. In situations that do not
require a specific PWM frequency, the PWM frequency should equal
approximately 1 five-hundredth the clock speed of the microcontroller
(ie 40 Khz on a 20 MHz chip, 16 KHz on an 8 MHz chip). This gives the
best duty cycle resolution possible.

`duty cycle` specifies the desired duty cycle of the PWM signal, and
ranges from 0 to 1023 where 1023 is 100% duty cycle.    This should be a
WORD value.    Note: Byte values are supported as a Byte value is
factorised to a Word value. To use a Byte value and to ensure the 10-bit
resolution you should cast the parameter as a Word, \[WORD\]byte\_value
or \[WORD\]constant\_value

`timer` specifies the desired timer to be used. These can be timer 2, 4
or 6.

Optional `resolution` specifies the desired resolution to be used. These
can be either 255 or 1023. The rational of this optional parameter is to
support the duty cycle with a BYTE or a WORD range. If you call the
method with a WORD the resolution will be set to 1023.

  
  
<span class="strong">**Notes:**</span>

PWM channels 1 and 2 are disable by default.  You must enable using the
constants USE\_HPWMn where n is the PWM channel you want to enable.  You
can disable any PWM channel by setting the appropiatge change to FALSE.

On some microcontrollers you may need to set the port.pin as an output
for PWM to operated as desired.
