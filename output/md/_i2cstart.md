PIC microcontrollers (10F, 12F5xx, 16F5xx chips)

<span class="strong">**Explanation:**</span>

If the I2C routines are operating in Master mode, this command will send
a start condition. If routines are in Slave mode, it will pause the
program until a start condition is sent by the master. It should be
placed at the start of every I2C transmission.

If interrupt handling is enabled, this command will disable it.
