The name of the file is specified in between &lt; and &gt; symbols. For instance, to include the file <code class="literal">toolchain.il</code>, the directive is:</p><pre class="screen">    #insert &lt;"toolchain.il"&gt;</pre><p>Relative is used to read files in the same folder as the currently selected program. Filenames are given enclosed in quotation marks, such as where <code class="literal">mycode.h</code> is the name of the file that is to be read.</p><pre class="screen">    #insert "toolchain.il"</pre><p><span class="strong"><strong>Difference from #include:</strong></span></p><p>This is very different from #include.&nbsp;&nbsp;
With #include you can organize constant, method and macro definitions and then use #include directive to add them to any source file.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Include files are also useful for incorporating declarations of external variables and complex data types. The types may be defined and named only once in an include file created for that purpose. The compiler will optimise the include files to determine the best order/location in your program.</p><p>Using #insert you are determining the location of the code segment.&nbsp;&nbsp;
It will be inserted exactly where you specify.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The optimisation will only be applied to any methods that you insert but the rest of the code essentially exits at the point of insertion.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>#Insert does not support Conversion:</strong></span></p><p>There is no conversion of the inserted file.&nbsp;&nbsp;For conversion use #Include.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>If you need to convert a file from an external source then see the Converters section of the Help.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Usage Notes:</strong></span></p><p>The file must exist. An error message is issued if not found.&nbsp;&nbsp;
When an error is encountered in the inserted file the error line number is in the format of xxxxyyyy.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Where xxxx is the code line number in the user program and the yyyy is the the line number in the inserted file.</p><p>An example error message.&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the source insert instruction is on line 6 and the error in the inserted file is on line 4.</p><pre class="screen">    An error has been found:
     insertexample.gcb (60004): Error: Syntax Error
    The message has been logged to the file Errors.txt.</pre></div></body></html>
