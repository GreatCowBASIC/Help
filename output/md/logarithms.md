GCBASIC support logarithmic functions through the include file
&lt;maths.h&gt;.

These functions compute base 2, base e and base 10 logarithms accurate
to 2 decimal places, +/- 0.01.

The values returned are fixed-point numbers, with two decimal places
assumed on the right. Or if you prefer, think of the values as being
scaled up by 100.

The input arguments are word-sized integers, 1 to 65535. Remember,
logarithms are not defined for non-positive numbers. It is the calling
programâ€™s responsibility to avoid these. Output values are also
word-sized.

Local variables consume 9 bytes, while the function parameters consume
another 4 bytes, for a grand total of 13 bytes of RAM used. The lookup
table takes 35 words of program memory.
