<span class="strong">**Syntax:**</span>

``` screen
  I2CReceive data
  I2CReceive data, ack
```

<span class="strong">**Command Availability:**</span>

Available on all microcontrollers except 12 bit instruction Microchip
PIC microcontrollers (10F, 12F5xx, 16F5xx chips)

<span class="strong">**Explanation:**</span>

The I2CReceive command will send `data` through the I2C connection. If
`ack` is TRUE, or no value is given for `ack`, then `I2CReceive` will
send an ack.

If in master mode, `I2CReceive` will read the data immediately.

If in slave mode, `I2CReceive` will wait for the master to send the data
before reading. When the method `I2CReceive` is used in Slave mode the
global variable `I2CMatch` will be set to true when the received value
is equal to the constant `I2C_ADDRESS`.

<span class="strong">**Example 1 - Master Mode:**</span>

``` screen
  ' I2C Receive - using the ChipIno board, see here for information. ' This program reads an I2C register and LED is set to on if the value  is over 100.
  ' This program will read from address 83, register 1.

  #chip 16F886, 8
  #config MCLRE_ON

  'I2C settings
  #define I2C_MODE Master
  #define I2C_DATA PORTC.4
  #define I2C_CLOCK PORTC.3

  'Misc settings
  #define LED PORTB.5
  dir LED Out

  'Main loop
  Do
    'Send start
    I2CStart

    'Request value
    I2CSend 83
    I2CSend 1

    'Read value
    I2CReceive ValueIn

    'Send stop
    I2CStop

    'Turn on LED if received value > 100
    Set LED Off
    If ValueIn > 100 Then Set LED On

    'Delay
    Wait 20 ms

  Loop
```

<span class="strong">**Example 2 - Slave Mode:**</span>

See the
<a href="i2c_overview" class="link" title="I2C Overview">I2C Overview</a>
for the Master mode device to control this Slave mode device.

``` screen
  ' I2CReceive_Slave.gcb - using a 16F88.
  ' This program receives commands from a GCB Master. This Slave has three LEDs attached.
