GCBASIC does not support decimal numbers.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Bit</strong></span> is used as a Flag or a Port Pin and has two states which may be:</p><pre class="screen">    ON or OFF
    TRUE or FALSE
    HIGH or LOW
    1 or 0
    SET or RESET</pre><p>other complementary states depending on how your application interprets and handles the data.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Byte</strong></span> is the most common size in 8 Bit devices and could represent a Number, an ASCII Character, a Port, two Nibbles (as used by Hex or BCD number systems), an Internal Register, an 8 bit Variable or any user defined collection of to eight Bits such as a group of flags.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Word</strong></span> is normally used for its Numeric value. 16 Bits will allow it to store Numbers from Zero to 65535 which is large enough to store the product of any two 8 bit Bytes without overflowing. &nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is not confined to being used as a numeric value.&nbsp;&nbsp; A Word may be used in any manner that your application needs depending on how it interprets the 16 Bits of data. Examples may be a memory address or a data pointer.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong>Note:</strong></span> The Word size of a device (as opposed to the Word Type above) is a representation of the number of Bits that it can manipulate simultaneously by the chip. &nbsp;&nbsp; The number of Bits for PIC and AVR Microcontrolers supported by GCBASIC are 8 Bits and so they are considered to have an 8 Bit Word.*</li></ul></div><p><span class="strong"><strong>Long</strong></span> is for situations where Values exceeding 65535 have to be handled and has a range of zero to 4294967295 (2^32-1).&nbsp;&nbsp;It is rarely used in 8 Bit devices but is invaluable on the rare occasions that it is needed. &nbsp;&nbsp; The Millis() is an example that  uses the Long Data Type to handle time periods of up to 50 days.</p><p>All of the above can be considered to be Integer Values of varying magnitude as they can hold non Fractional Positive Whole Numbers, but try not to confuse <span class="strong"><strong>Integer Values</strong></span> with the <span class="strong"><strong>Integer Variable Type</strong></span>, they are complementary but separate concepts as you will see below.</p><p>An <span class="strong"><strong>integer</strong></span> is a whole number (not a fractional number) that can be Positive, Negative, or Zero.</p><p>In your application there may be a need to be able represent Negative Numbers in our variables and that is where the GCBASIC <span class="strong"><strong>Integer Variable Type</strong></span> is useful.  An <span class="strong"><strong>Integer Variable</strong></span> is similar to the <span class="strong"><strong>Word Variable</strong></span> as they are both 16 bits. &nbsp;&nbsp; The difference how the GCBASIC compiler interprets the data bits that it contains.</p><p>The compiler will treat a <span class="strong"><strong>Word Variable Type</strong></span> as a Variable that can store the values 0 &lt; 65535 but it will see the <span class="strong"><strong>Integer Variable Type</strong></span> as a Variable that can store values of -32768 &lt; 0 &lt;32767.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Variable size</strong></span></p><p>Each type of variable is defined in various bit lengths, in this case GCBASIC  these are:</p><pre class="screen">    Byte                 8 Bit
    Integer             16 Bit
    Word                16 Bit
    Long                32 Bit</pre><p>All four of the above are number types are true Integers. &nbsp;&nbsp;In that they are representations of a integer non fractional number as follows:</p><pre class="screen">    8  Bit - an 8 Bit number can be in the range of 0 to 255
    16 Bit - a 16 Bit number can be in the range of 0 to 65535
    32 Bit - a 32 Bit number can be in the range of 0 to 43294967295</pre><p>But, they can only represent positive numbers. &nbsp;&nbsp;In Mathematics there is a need for an Integer that can be Positive, Negative, or Zero. &nbsp;&nbsp;Note that Zero is always a Positive Whole Number.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Two&#8217;s Complement</strong></span></p><p>To take the Two&#8217;s Complement of a number it is inverted then incremented:</p><pre class="screen">        MyVar = NOT MyVar + 1</pre><p>The increment, of adding 1, has two effects, it avoids the possible creation of a negative zero as a value of 1000000 would be seen as -128 and it allows subtraction to be achieved through addition.</p><p>If MyVar contained a value of 1 the 8 Bit representation would be:</p><pre class="screen">    00000001</pre><p>The NOT will make it</p><pre class="screen">    11111110</pre><p>Note that the Most significant Bit is now 1 so as a signed value it is negative.</p><p>The increment will result in a value of:</p><pre class="screen">    11111111</pre><p>So Minus one using an 8 Bit representation in Two&#8217;s Complement notation is 11111111</p><p>Let&#8217;s test it by adding -1 to plus 3</p><pre class="screen">    11111111    -1
    00000011 +   3
    ==============
    00000010     2</pre><p>We have successfully subtracted 1 from 3 by adding Minus 1 to 3 and obtaining a result of 2.</p><p>Notice that while a Byte is normally used to represent 0 &lt; 255 by making the MSB (Most Significant Bit) into a sign bit the maximum value is now 127.&nbsp;&nbsp; A signed 8 Bit integer can represent numbers in the range -128 &lt; 0 &lt; 127. &nbsp;&nbsp;That is still 256 values including Zero but they can now be Negative or Positive numbers.</p><p>The benefit of the two&#8217;s complement method is that it works for any size of variable:</p><pre class="screen">    MyByte = NOT MyByte +1
    MyWord = NOT MyWord +1
    MyLong = NOT MyLong +1</pre><p>All of the above will result in a Negated version of the original contents.</p><p>But not all, in fact relatively few, methods of a microcontroller require negative values so in situations where negative values are not required the loss of half of the magnitude of a Byte or Word can be significant. That is why it is necessary to be able to specify if a value is Signed or Unsigned, that is if the MSB is the sign bit or part of the value.</p><p>It is obviously important from the above that the user program ds need to know what sort of data to expect as a value of 0xFF could be considered to be both 255 and -1 depending on the interpretation of the variable. &nbsp;&nbsp; That is why it is important to have Signed and Unsigned Data Types so that the compiler can decide how to handle or interpret the contents. &nbsp;&nbsp;As show above in GCBASIC those types are referred to as Integer and Word respectively.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Summary</strong></span></p><p>GCBASIC implements support for Bit, Byte, Word, Integer and Long Variable Types, all of which are described above.</p><p>And, that negative numbers are represented as two&#8217;s complement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div></body></html>
