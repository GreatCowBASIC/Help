    Dir LED Out

    Do
      LED = !LED
      Wait 500 ms
    Loop</pre><p>That is it. If you have an LED attached to PortC.0 (LED DS1 on the Low Pin Count Board that shipped with the PICKit 2 or PICKit 3 programmer).&nbsp;&nbsp;  It will start to Blink confirming that you have a working microcontroller and hardware.</p><p>To change target device or family just change the #Chip Entry along with the Pin you have the LED on and recompile.&nbsp;&nbsp; it Really IS as Simple as that to get started in GCBASIC.</p><p>You can manually override GCBASIC and set every register, every flag, every BIT, every Configuration &#8216;Fuse&#8217; and every vector if you wish, but why bother doing it upfront? &nbsp;&nbsp;Rather get your code working with the default settings and then adjust from there, if needed, as your confidence grows.</p><p>One final bit of advice, the IDE tool bar has a &#8220;View Demos&#8221; button, use it, there are examples of all of the most common programming challenges and many different devices which, along with the Help files, will answer most of your questions. The Forum is a friendly place too, so do not be shy to introduce yourself and ask for help.</p></div></body></html>
