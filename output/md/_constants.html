string, and replace it with another string. The <code class="literal">#Define</code> directive create constants.</p><p>Constants are useful for situations where a routine needs to be easily altered. For example, a define could be used to specify the amount of time to run an alarm for
once triggered.</p><p>It is also possible to use defines to specify port.pin(s) - thus defines can
be used to aid in the creation of code that can easily be adapted to run
on a different microcontroller with different ports.</p><p>GCBASIC makes considerable use of defines internally. For instance, the
LCD code uses defines to set the ports that it must use to communicate
with the LCD.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>About Defines</strong></span></p><p>To create a constant is a matter of using the #define directive. Here are
some examples of defines:</p><pre class="screen">    #define LINE 34
    #define LIGHT PORTB.0
    #define LIGHTON Set PORTB.0 ON</pre><p><code class="literal">LINE</code> is a simple constant - GCBASIC will find <code class="literal">LINE</code> in the program, and
replace it with the number 34. This could be used in a line following
program, to make it easier to calibrate the program for different
lighting conditions.</p><p><code class="literal">LIGHT</code> is a port.pin - it represents a particular pin on the microcontroller. This
would be of use if the program had many lines of code that controlled
the light, and there was a possibility that the port the light was
attached to would need to change in the future.</p><p><code class="literal">LIGHTON</code> is a define used to make the program more readable. Rather than
typing <code class="literal">Set PORTB.0 ON</code> over and over, it would then be made possible to
type <code class="literal">LIGHTON</code>, and have the compiler do the hard work.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>GCBASIC Defined constants</strong></span></p><p>The are many GCBASIC standard constants, some are show below.</p><pre class="screen">    #define ON 1
    #define OFF 0
    #define TRUE 255
    #define FALSE 0

    'Names for symbols
    #define AND &amp;
    #define OR |
    #define XOR #
    #define NOT !
    #define MOD %</pre><p><span class="strong"><strong>A GCBASIC special constant</strong></span></p><p><code class="literal">FOREVER</code> is a special constant.  For Graphical GCBASIC users think of this as 'false'. For those not using Graphical GCBASIC think of this as a non numeric value that has no value.  You can use <code class="literal">FOREVER</code> in a DO-LOOP but not in a REPEAT-END REPEAT loop, as the in the later case the REPEAT will have no value and you will create an error condition.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Precedence of Constants within GCBASIC.</strong></span>
<br>
<br>
The <code class="literal">#define</code> command creates constants, and, scripts also creates constants.  See the <code class="literal">#script</code> section of ths Help.
<br>
<br>
The precedence is as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">Constants defined in the main user program is read first,</li><li class="listitem">then, the constants defined in the include files. Constants defined in the include files are ignored if they conflict or are different to a constant, with the same title, in the main program.</li><li class="listitem">then, the scripts are processed. Scripts that create constants can therefore override any constant value previously defined.</li></ul></div><p>All constants are listed in the Constant Debug File ( CDF ).  The CDF shows all constants and the end state of the constants.
