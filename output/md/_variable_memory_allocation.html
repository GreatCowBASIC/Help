<span class="strong"><strong>Variable Aliases</strong></span></p><p>Variable can be defined as  aliases. &nbsp;&nbsp; Aliases  are used to refer to existing memory locations SFR or RAM and aliases can be used to construct other variables.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Constructed variables can be a mix  ( or not ) of SFR or RAM.  &nbsp;&nbsp; These are useful for joining predefined byte variables together to form a word/long variable.</p><p>Aliases are not like pointers in many languages - they must always refer to an existing variable or variables and cannot be changed.</p><p>When setting a register/variable bit ( i.e  my_variable.my_bit_address_variable ) and using a alias for the variable then you must ensure the bytes that construct the variable are consecutive.</p><p>Aliases are shown in the ASM source in the ;ALIAS VARIABLES section.</p><p>The coding approach should be to DIMension the variable (word, integer, or long) first, then create the byte aliases:</p><pre class="screen">    Dim my_variable as LONG
    Dim ByteOne   as Byte alias my_variable_E
    Dim ByteTwo   as Byte alias my_variable_U
    Dim ByteThree as Byte alias my_variable_H
    Dim ByteFour  as Byte alias my_variable

    Dim my_bit_address_variable as Byte
    my_bit_address_variable = 23

    'set the bit in the variable
    my_variable.my_bit_address_variable = 1

    'then, use the four byte variables as you need to.</pre><p>To set a series of registers that are not consecutive, it is recommended to use a mask variable then apply it to the registers:</p><pre class="screen">    Dim my_variable as LONG
    Dim my_bit_address_variable as Byte
    my_bit_address_variable = 23

    'set the bit in the variable
    my_variable.my_bit_address_variable = 1

    porta =  my_variable_E
    portb =  my_variable_E
    portc =  my_variable_E
    portd =  my_variable_E</pre><p><span class="strong"><strong>Memory Specification</strong></span></p><p>All memory specifics like RAM size, lower and upper RAM addresses are specified in the chip specific dat file.</p><p>The dat file details should be reviewed in PICINFO application.   See the PICINFO/CHIPDATA tab for RAM and MaxAddress etc.</p><p>A simple calculation is MaxAddress - RAM +1 = the 'first memory address'.  And, 'first memory address' + RAM -1 = 'the last memory address.</p><p>This can be confirmed by review the DAT file. See the section [FreeRAM] for the start and end of RAM.</p><p>The dat file also has a [NoBankRAM].  NoBankRAM is somewhat misnamed - it is used for the defintion of (any) access bank locations.&nbsp;&nbsp; If a memory location is defined in both NoBankRAM and FreeRAM, then the compiler knows that it is access bank RAM.&nbsp;&nbsp;If an SFR location is in one of the NoBankRAM ranges, then the compiler knows not to do any bank selection when accessing that register.</p><p>The [NoBankRAM] section includes two ranges, one for access bank RAM, one for access bank SFRs.
The first range MUST be the ACCESS RAM range
The first range is the FAST SFR range</p><p>If there are no ranges defined in NoBankRAM, the compiler will try to guess them.&nbsp;&nbsp;
On 18Fs, it will guess based on where the lowest SFR is, and from what the total RAM on the chip is.&nbsp;&nbsp; If there&#8217;s only one range defined. &nbsp;&nbsp; in the NoBankRAM locations, the compiler will assume that is the range for the RAM, and then will guess where the range for the access bank SFRs is.</p><pre class="screen">    'GCBASIC/GCGB Chip Data File
