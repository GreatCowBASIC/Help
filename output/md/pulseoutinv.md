``` screen
    PulseOutInv pin, time units
```

<span class="strong">**Command Availability:**</span>

Available on all microcontrollers.

<span class="strong">**Explanation:**</span>

The `PulseOutInv` command will set the specified pin low, wait for the
specified amount of time, and then set the pin high. The pin is
specified in the same way as it is for the `Set` command, and the time
is the same as for the `Wait` command.

``` screen
    'This program flashes an LED on GPIO.0 using PulseOutInv
    #chip 12F629, 4

        PulseOutInv GPIO.0, 1 sec     'Turn LED off for 1 sec
        Wait 1 sec                    'Wait 1 sec with LED on
