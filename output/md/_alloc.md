<span class="strong">**About Alloc**</span>

Alloc creates a special type of variable - an array variant.   This
array variant can store values.   The values stored in this array
variant must be of the same type.

Essentially, ALLOCate will reserve a memory range as described by the
given layout that can be used as a RAM buffer or as an array variant.

Layout:

``` screen
  Dim variable_name as ALLOC * memory_size at memory_location
```

The allocated block of memory will not be initialized.

Example Usage:

``` screen
  Dim my256bytebuffer as alloc * 256 at 0x2400
```

There is a pointer to allocated memory. Use @variable\_name.

Example Pointer

``` screen
    HSerPrint @my256bytebuffer
```

<span class="strong">**Extents**</span>

This method can be unsafe because undefined behaviour can result if the
caller does not ensure that buffer extents are not maintained.    Buffer
extents are 0 (zero) to the memory\_size - 1

Example Extents:

``` screen
    my256bytebuffer(0)    = some_variable.  Will address location 0x2400
    my256bytebuffer(255)  = some_variable.  Will address location 0x24FF ' the 256th byte of the allocated memory
```

Implementers of ALLOC must ensure memory constraints remain true.

<span class="strong">**Safety**</span>

This method is unsafe because undefined behaviour can result if the
caller does not ensure that buffer extents are not maintained.    If
buffer extents are exceeded the program may address areas of memory that
have adverse impact on the operation of the microcontroller.

Examples of unsafe usage:

``` screen
    my256bytebuffer(256) = some_variable.  Will address location 0x2500  ' this is the first byte of BUFFER RAM on the 18FxxQ43 chips... bad things may happen
    my256bytebuffer(65535) = some_variable.  Will address location 0x123FF  ' this is the beyond the memory limit and the operation will write an SFR.
```

<span class="strong">**Example Program**</span>

The following example program shows the ALLOCation of a 256 byte buffer
at a specific address.   The array variant is then populated with data
and then shown on a serial terminal.

``` screen
