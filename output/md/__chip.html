Some alternative compilers allow value of the clock frequency to be set with the numerical value in Hertz (<span class="emphasis"><em>i.e.</em></span> 24576000). This can be useful when using the clock frequencies other than standard frequencies.</p><p>GCBASIC requires clock frequencys to be specified in MHz, but will accept decimal points. For example, if you wanted to run a 16F1827 at 24576000 Hz, you would write the following:</p><pre class="screen">    #chip 16F1827, 24.576</pre><p><span class="strong"><strong>GCBASIC support for microcontrollers:</strong></span></p><p>Each microcontroller has a microcontroller data file.

Unlike Picaxe Basic (and other compilers) GCBASIC delays ("wait") are correct regardless of the setting of FOSC.

However, the wait times will be incorrect as they will be calculated by the compiler based upon a 12 Mhz clock.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>ConfigOps section</strong></span></p><p>The [ConfigOps] section of 12F1840.dat is towards the end of the chip data file.

<code class="literal">INTOSC</code> is the internal oscillator. All others are some form of external clock source.
<code class="literal">PLLEN</code> sets the internal Phase Lock Loop either on or off. With this chip the default clock frequency is 8 Mhz. The PLL multiplies this by 4. So to get 32 Mhz the basic internal oscillator will be 8 Mhz then multiplied by 4. For 16 MHz it wil be 4 multiplied by 2.</p><p>GCB sets the PLL automatically, so this option should generally be left alone. IF PLLEN is set to ON, then GCB may not be able to set the correct frewuency of the internal oscillator. Only set PLL = ON if you know what you are doing.</p><p>It is a good practice to set the oscillator source in #config at the beginning of your code when you are not using the internal oscillator.  This prevents potential errors. Example:</p><pre class="screen">    #Chip 12F1840, 16
    #Config OSC = INTOSC   'This is normally not required as the internal oscillator is the default oscillator.</pre><p>In  this example above, GCBASIC will automatically set the necessary OSC bits for the microcontroller. Frequency bits will be set to 4 MHz and the PLL will be turned on and wait times will be calculated on an FOSC of 16.</p><p>You can set the clock to other frequencies but you have to put the PIC into <code class="literal">EC</code> or <code class="literal">External Clock</code> mode and then supply that specific clock frequency to the OSC1 pin.</p><p>There are three EC modes on the PIC12F1840:</p><pre class="screen">    ECL - 0 MHz - 0.5 MHz
    ECM - 0.5 MHz - 4 MHz
    ECH = 4 MHz - 32MHz</pre><p>Example: For a 2.1 MHz clock you would need to set the #config and the clock frequency, and, provide the OSC1 pin with a 2.1 MHz signal.</p><pre class="screen">    #chip 12f1840,2.1
    #config OSC = ECM</pre><p><span class="strong"><strong>Notes</strong></span></p><p>When "#config osc=" is not specified in the source code, most microcontrollers will default to an external oscillator source. This means at runtime the chip is expecting an external clock signal.  If the external clock signal is not present, the chip detects a "failure" of the external clock and will  "falls back" to the default internal oscillator setting.</p><p>The PLLEN bit defaults to OFF. The PLL is enabled depending upon the ChipMhz in #Chip xxxxxx, ChipMhz.</p><p>The GCBASIC defaults - This is how the bits are set if there is no #config in the source code, GCBASIC does set certain bits.  To examine what bits are set on a particular chip you can omit #config in the source code, thenm compile the code and then use "Open ASM" in the GCBASIC IDE. The bits that are set will be in the config section. All other bits ( those not specifically set) with #Config will be at the POR setting as described below, The <code class="literal">POR</code> settings are shown in the datasheet for each microcontroller.</p><p>Currently GCBASIC sets the <code class="literal">LVP</code> bit <code class="literal">OFF</code> by default on many chips. This does not affect normal HV programming like a with a PicKit3.   The default of LVP = OFF  will prevent the microcontroller from being programmed with Low Voltage Programmer. This means that if a PIC microcontroller has previously been programmed with with "LVP =  OFF",  then it must be erased or reprogrammed with LVP = ON using a HVP programmer prior to using certain programming devices e.g. Curiosity development boards, or "NS"  programmers as these  required that LVP = ON.</p><p>When LVP = ON, the MCLR pin is automatically set to EXTERNAL MCLR.  This means that the MCLRE pin CANNOT be sue for general purpose I/O functions.</p><p>The native <code class="literal">POR</code> (Power On Reset) defaults. This is the state of the config bits after Power on if the ASM code has no configuration entries or on a blank factory chip. The only way to power up in this state with GCB code is to use " #option NoConfig" in the GCBASIC source code.</p></div></body></html>
