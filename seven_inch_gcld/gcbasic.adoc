*Display*

LT768x is a high-performance TFT-LCD graphic accelerated display controller.&#160;&#160;
The LT768x supports the control of the contents on the TFT screen.&#160;&#160;
The LT768x also provides graphic acceleration, PIP (picture-in-picture), geometry graphics and other functions.&#160;&#160;
In addition to enhancing the display efficiency, LT768x can also ease the MCU loading on processing graphic data.&#160;&#160;
The LT768x supports 16bit RGB interface.&#160;&#160;

LT768x supports a variety of MCU interface, including SPI, I2C serial port,
and 8-bit/16-bit parallel interface.&#160;&#160;The GCBASIC library will support SPI , as this is a constraint of the GLCD hardware implementation.&#160;&#160;
In order to achieve multi-layers high-resolution display effect, it has a built-in 128Mb Display RAM, which can support assorted color depths from 1bit per pixel (2 gray shades) to
24bits per pixel (16M color), and alleviate the processing burden on MCU while displaying animation.&#160;&#160;
With built-in geometric drawing engine, LT768X supports drawing points, lines, curves, ellipse, triangle, rectangle, rounded rectangle, and other functions.

In addition, LT768x has an embedded hardware graphics acceleration
engine (BTE), which provides command-type graphic operations such as screen rotation, flipping, mirroring, PIP and graphics blending, and transparent display. These functions can greatly enhance the display performance, and ease the processing burden on the MCU.  

The powerful display performance of LT768x is ideal for embedded systems with TFT-LCD displays such as home appliances, industrial controls, electronic instruments,
medical devices, human-machine interfaces, industrial equipment, inspection equipment, charging stations, multi-function machines, elevator, check-in gate, etc.

The official Levetop YouTube site is https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-ieq6xtBdsOVwB00ysNHjQ

The GLCD has a shape drawing engine to provide smart drawing features:  Line, Rectangle, Triangle, Polygon, Poly-Line, Circle, Ellipse, Arc, and Rounded-Rectangle.&#160;&#160; 
Characters/text features  embedded 8*16, 12*24, 16*32 character sets of iso/iec 8859-1/2/4/5  user-defined characters support half size & full size for 8*16, 12*24 and 16*32.&#160;&#160;
The GLCD operating voltage (VCC) is 5v0 with microcontroller signals at 3v3.



This GLCD library has many features similar to the Nextion GLCD.  However, GCBASIC has to control more of the display events and pixel controller.

== Operating Voltage of the GLCD

The PCB has a VCC of 5V0, and, all signals must be 3v3 ( for LCD and CTP ). 

The datasheets state the PCB has a VCC5V, and the `LCD I/O operating voltage` as 3v3.&#160;&#160;This makes sense but it could be better stated as `LCD I/O signal voltage`` as 3v3.

  
The datasheets also state the CTP `supply voltage` as 3.3..&#160;&#160;This would be better written as `CTP I/O signal voltage` as 3v3.


Note: The microcontroller signals *MUST* be 3v3 for the GLCD to operate within the operating constraints. 

== Operating and Signal Voltages of the Microcontroller

The microcontroller operating must be correct for the operating voltage of the GLCD..&#160;&#160;The safe option is to operate the microcontroller at 3v3.&#160;&#160;Another option would be operate the microcontroller at 5v0 and use a voltage leveler translator.

A voltage level translator, also called level converter or logic level shifter, or level shifter, is a circuit used to translate signals from one logic level or voltage domain to another, allowing compatibility between the GLCD and the microcontroller.


If a voltage level translator is required then two 8-bit voltage level translators will be required to support the 10-bit GLCD and CTP signals.&#160;&#160;6-bits for the GLCD and 4-bits for the CTP.&#160;&#160;A common 0v0 (GND), 3v3 and 5v0 is required across the microcontroller, the PCB and the voltage level translators.

== Connections between Microcontroller and the GLCD

The following table shows the connections required to operate the GLCD and the CTP.&#160;&#160;

The diagram below shows the basic connection to with the microcontroller operating at 3v3.
----

    PCB  ---
            \----------|- 5v0 power supply to LCD PCB
            PCB -------|- 3v3 all signals from microcontroller
            /----------|- 0v0 ( GND ) common

            /-------------------------------------|-  0v0 ( GND ) common

----

The advised method to connect as follows:

1. Connect the 0v0 and 5v0.&#160;&#160;Inspect the current to ensure this is within operating limit.
2. Connect the LCD.&#160;&#160;Inspect the current to ensure this is within operating limit.&#160;&#160;Use the `GLCD_PORTTEST_7INCHSURENOO.GCB` to ensure each signal is correct.&#160;&#160;See the next section for details.
3. Connect the CPT.&#160;&#160;Inspect the current to ensure this is within operating limit.&#160;&#160;Use the `CPT_PORTTEST_7INCHSURENOO.GCB` to ensure each signal is correct.&#160;&#160;See the next section for details.

== Initial 'Power on' of GLCD 

The initial power up of the GLCD to the correct operating unfortunately shows nothing on the GLCD.&#160;&#160;The integrated flash on the Blue or Black PC contains no default information for the LCD.&#160;&#160;

Therefore, unfortunately, upon powering a GLCD black display is shown with no demonstration of activity to provide any operational assurance.

    Note: Surenoo intend to load a default screen to the GLCD, and, the production of Development Board to showcase the features of these displays.

== Initialise SPI Flash 

The GLCD has a power-on display circuit  embedded into small microprocessor unit.&#160;&#160;The main function is to quickly display the screen at boot time by executing the program code stored in Flash memory in the absence of
Host, or when the Host is still in its start-up phase.&#160;&#160;
To use this function, PWM[0] pin must connect to a 10K pull-up resistor, then the "Power-On Display" function will be enabled.&#160;&#160;
When Power-on Display is enabled, the GLCD will automatically execute the program until the program code in the Flash memory is fully executed. After that, Host will retrieve the control of the system.

The goal is to program the Flash memory to initialise the GLCD with your logo or other user specfic information.&#160;&#160;This will be achieved using a GCBASIC program to program the FLASH memory to show a picture.&#160;&#160;This means the GLCD will be operting without the microcontroller to prove the GLCD is operating as expected.

The steps are:

1. Connect the microcontroller to the Flash memory SPI connector via a Flat Flexible Cable and a CB Converter Board Couple Extend Adapter.
2. Provide 3v0, and, connect the microcontroller to the correct microcontroller ports.
3. Program the Flash memory using the provide Flash memory GCBASIC program.&#160;&#160;See below.
4. Disconnect the microcontroller and reset the GCLD.
5. Enjoy the display on the GLCD.

Note:: The W25Q128JVSQ (128M-bit) Serial Flash memory provides a storage solution for systems with limited space, pins and power,sop8 package. The W25Q128JVSQ  offers flexibility and performance well beyond ordinary Serial Flash devices. They are ideal for code shadowing to RAM, executing code directly from Dual/Quad SPI (XIP) and storing voice, text and data. The device operates on a single 2.7V to 3.6V power supply with current consumption as low as 4mA active for power-down. All devices are offered in space-saving packages. + 
+ 
The W25Q128JVSQ array is organized into 65,536 programmable pages of 256-bytes each. Up to 256 bytes can be programmed at a time. Pages can be erased in groups of 16 (4KB sector erase), groups of 128 (32KB block erase), groups of 256 (64KB block erase) or the entire chip (chip erase). 
+ 
The W25Q128JVSQ has 4,096 erasable sectors and 256 erasable blocks respectively. The small 4KB sectors allow for greater flexibility in applications that require data and parameter storage.
+ 
The W25Q128JVSQ support the standard Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI), Dual/Quad I/O SPI as well as 2-clocks instruction cycle Quad Peripheral Interface (QPI): Serial Clock, Chip Select, Serial Data I/O0 (DI),I/O1 (DO), I/O2 (/WP), and I/O3 (/HOLD). SPI clock frequencies of up to 104MHz are supported allowing equivalent clock rates of 208MHz (104MHz x 2) for Dual I/O and 416MHz (104MHz x 4) for Quad I/O when using the Fast Read Dual/Quad I/O and QPI instructions. These transfer rates can outperform standard Asynchronous 8 and 16-bit Parallel Flash memories. The Continuous Read Mode allows for efficient memory access with as few as 8-clocks of instruction-overhead to read a 24-bit address, allowing true XIP (execute in place) operation.  
+ 
A Hold pin, Write Protect pin and programmable write protection, with top or bottom array control, provide further control flexibility. Additionally, the device supports JEDEC standard manufacturer and device ID and SFDP Register, a 64-bit Unique Serial Number and three 256-bytes Security Registers.
+
The W25Q256JV is accessed through an SPI compatible bus consisting of four signals: Serial Clock (CLK), Chip Select (/CS), Serial Data Input (DI) and Serial Data Output (DO).&#160;&#160;Standard SPI instructions use the DI input pin to serially write instructions, addresses or data to the device on the rising edge of
CLK.&#160;&#160;The DO output pin is used to read data or status from the device on the falling edge of CLK.&#160;&#160;
+
SPI bus operation Mode 0 (0,0) and 3 (1,1) are supported. The primary difference between Mode 0 and Mode 3 concerns the normal state of the CLK signal when the SPI bus master is in standby and data is not being transferred to the Serial Flash.&#160;&#160;For Mode 0, the CLK signal is normally low on the falling and
rising edges of /CS.&#160;&#160;For Mode 3, the CLK signal is normally high on the falling and rising edges of /CS
+
The first clock signal falling can be used to prepare the data transmission.&#160;&#160;The clock idle state should be high.&#160;&#160;The data on DO and DI lines must be stable while the clock is high and can be changed when the clock is low.&#160;&#160;The data is set on the clocks low-to-high transition and propagated on high-to-low clock transition.

The GLCD implementation of W25Q256JV requires a specific SPI Mode.&#160;&#160;The SPI mode is critical to update the Flash Memory.&#160;&#160;The Flash Memory has a shared data and clock lines with the GLCD IC.&#160;&#160;Therefore, the SPI mode used by GCBASIC needs to match the GLCD IC SPI mode.


*GCBASIC program for Flash Memory writing*

Setup the program source, and, program the microcontroller.

Note:: To program the Flash Memory the GLCD must have the LCD_RST connection on the Flash Memory connector to 0v0.&#160;&#160;**This is critical**.
