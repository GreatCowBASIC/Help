== Introducing the 7 Inch GLCD Library

The 7 Inch GLCD Library uses the SSP0700 Series displays.  The GLCD supports 7.0 Inch 1024*600 or 800*480 with the LT7686 controller with 3 or 4 Wire Serial SPI interface.&#160;&#160;
The library also supports Capacitive Touch Panel with the GT5426 with an I2C interface.

*Display*

LT768x is a high-performance TFT-LCD graphic accelerated display controller.&#160;&#160;
The LT768x supports the control of the contents on the TFT screen.&#160;&#160;
The LT768x also provides graphic acceleration, PIP (picture-in-picture), geometry graphics and other functions.&#160;&#160;
In addition to enhancing the display efficiency, LT768x can also ease the MCU loading on processing graphic data.&#160;&#160;
The LT768x supports 16bit RGB interface.&#160;&#160;

LT768x supports a variety of MCU interface, including SPI, I2C serial port,
and 8-bit/16-bit parallel interface.&#160;&#160;The GCBASIC library supports SPI only, this is a constraint of the GLCD implementation.&#160;&#160;
In order to achieve multi-layers high-resolution display effect, it has a built-in 128Mb Display RAM, which can support assorted color depths from 1bit per pixel (2 gray shades) to
24bits per pixel (16M color), and alleviate the processing burden on MCU while displaying animation.&#160;&#160;
With built-in geometric drawing engine, LT768X supports drawing points, lines, curves, ellipse, triangle, rectangle, rounded rectangle, and other functions.

&#160;&#160;In addition, LT768x has an embedded hardware graphics acceleration
engine (BTE), which provides command-type graphic operations such as screen rotation, flipping, mirroring, PIP and graphics blending, and transparent display. These functions can greatly enhance the display performance, and ease the processing burden on the MCU.  

The powerful display performance of LT768x is ideal for embedded systems with TFT-LCD displays such as home appliances, industrial controls, electronic instruments,
medical devices, human-machine interfaces, industrial equipment, inspection equipment, charging stations, multi-function machines, elevator, check-in gate, etc.


The GLCD operating voltage (VCC) is 5v0 with microcontroller signals at 3v3.

The GLCD has a shape drawing engine to provide smart drawing features:  Line, Rectangle, Triangle, Polygon, Poly-Line, Circle, Ellipse, Arc, and Rounded-Rectangle. 
Characters/text features  embedded 8*16, 12*24, 16*32 character sets of iso/iec 8859-1/2/4/5  user-defined characters support half size & full size for 8*16, 12*24 and 16*32


This GLCD library has many features similar to the Nextion GLCD.  However, GCBASIC has to control more of the display events and pixel controller.

== Operating Voltage of the GLCD

The PCB has a VCC of 5V0, and, all signals must be 3v3 ( for LCD and CTP ). 

The datasheets state the PCB has a VCC5V, and the `LCD I/O operating voltage` as 3v3.&#160;&#160;This makes sense but it could be better stated as `LCD I/O signal voltage`` as 3v3.

  
The datasheets also state the CTP `supply voltage` as 3.3..&#160;&#160;This would be better written as `CTP I/O signal voltage` as 3v3.


Note: The microcontroller signals *MUST* be 3v3 for the GLCD to operate within the operating constraints. 

== Operating and Signal Voltages of the Microcontroller

The microcontroller operating must be correct for the operating voltage of the GLCD..&#160;&#160;The safe option is to operate the microcontroller at 3v3.&#160;&#160;Another option would be operate the microcontroller at 5v0 and use a voltage leveler translator.

A voltage level translator, also called level converter or logic level shifter, or level shifter, is a circuit used to translate signals from one logic level or voltage domain to another, allowing compatibility between the GLCD and the microcontroller.


If a voltage level translator is required then two 8-bit voltage level translators will be required to support the 10-bit GLCD and CTP signals.&#160;&#160;6-bits for the GLCD and 4-bits for the CTP.&#160;&#160;A common 0v0 (GND), 3v3 and 5v0 is required across the microcontroller, the PCB and the voltage level translators.

== Connections between Microcontroller and the GLCD

The following table shows the connections required to operate the GLCD and the CTP.&#160;&#160;

The diagram below shows the basic connection to with the microcontroller operating at 3v3.
----

    PCB  ---
            \----------|- 5v0 power supply to LCD PCB
            PCB -------|- 3v3 all signals from microcontroller
            /----------|- 0v0 ( GND ) common

             \                                    /----|- 3v3 all signals from microcontroller   
             PCB ---- Voltage Level Translator --|
                                                  \- 3v3 power supply to voltage level translator(s)
            /-------------------------------------|-  0v0 ( GND ) common

----

The advised method to connect as follows:

1. Connect the 0v0 and 5v0.&#160;&#160;Inspect the current to ensure this is within operating limit.
2. Connect the LCD.&#160;&#160;Inspect the current to ensure this is within operating limit.&#160;&#160;Use the `GLCD_PORTTEST_7INCHSURENOO.GCB` to ensure each signal is correct.&#160;&#160;See the next section for details.
3. Connect the CPT.&#160;&#160;Inspect the current to ensure this is within operating limit.&#160;&#160;Use the `CPT_PORTTEST_7INCHSURENOO.GCB` to ensure each signal is correct.&#160;&#160;See the next section for details.

== Initial 'Power on' of GLCD 

The initial power up of the GLCD to the correct operating unfortunately shows nothing on the GLCD.&#160;&#160;The integrated flash on the Blue or Black PC contains no default information for the LCD.&#160;&#160;

Therefore, unfortunately, upon powering a GLCD black display is shown with no demonstration of activity to provide any operational assurance.

    Note: Surenoo intend to load a default screen to the GLCD, and, the production of Development Board to showcase the features of these displays.
