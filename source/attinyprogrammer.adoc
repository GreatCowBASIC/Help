=== Setup an AVRISP MKII or USBtinyISP for ATTINY10 chip under Windows 

*AVRISP MKII Windows Driver Validation/Changing*


Windows 10 and 11 tested.

When using the AVRDUDE, which is used as part of the GCBASIC toolchain, you need to ensure these programmers are operating with the correct Windows device driver.&#160;&#160;
The Windows driver must be `libusbK` not `libusb or libusb-win32` Windows driver.

You must ensure the Windows driver is `libusbK`.&#160;&#160;Using the utility Zadig enables changing the Windows device driver to `libusbK`.


* Download and install Zadig Driver Utility software https://zadig.akeo.ie/
* Connect the USB cable from the AVRISP MKII to your PC.
* Open Zadig and from the menu select Options / List All Devices.
* From the device list select AVRISP MKII.
* Select the target driver libusbK and click (Install / Replace Driver) button.

After the installation is completed, open Windows Device Manager and verify the driver installation.

Close Zadig

NOTE: If you use ATMEL Studio you must ensure the Windows device driver is `libusb or libusb-win32`.

NOTE: If you use AVRDUDE then uou must ensure the Windows device driver is `libusbK`.



Next in the process is to upgrade the firmware of the AVRISP MKII.

*Option 1:*

This process shows the installation of Atmel Studio 7, however, you may have to use Atmel Studio 6 because of operation system constraint.

Download and Install Atmel Studio 7 from the GCBASIC file store https://sourceforge.net/projects/gcbasic/files/Support%20Files/ATMELCompilers/[here]

After the installation open ATMEL STUDIO 7

* Select Tools / Device Programming
* Make sure the AVRISP MKII is selected
* At this point ATMEL STUDIO will notified to upgrade the firmware to version 1.8
* Click the Upgrade  button
* Once the firmware is upgraded, close ATMEL STUDIO 7

*Option 2:*

To update the firmware please, follow the steps listed below.  

* Connect the programmer to the USB and with a sharp object (needle or pin) press the upgrade pin - it is in a small hole at the back of the board (this will start the bootloader and will turn off the LED, it will also probably show a new unrecognized device in the device manager for which we will install drivers in step 3)
* Download and install the latest version of "Atmel Flip" software (it can be downloaded from the Atmel's web-site, or from the GCBASIC file store https://sourceforge.net/projects/gcbasic/files/Support%20Files/ATMELCompilers/AVRISPMk2/[here] )
* Open its install folder and update the software of the unrecognized device (usually under the "Other devices" tab) with the drivers from folder named "usb"; the device should now be recognized as AT90USB162 under "libusb-win32" tab
* Start "Atmel FLIP" and click "Select a target device" -> choose AT90USB162
* Click "Select a Communication Medium" and then USB medium
* Download the firware and unpack https://www.olimex.com/Products/AVR/Programmers/AVR-ISP-MK2/resources/AVR456-studio-AVRISP-MKII.zip[Olimex website] or the GCBASIC files store https://sourceforge.net/projects/gcbasic/files/Support%20Files/ATMELCompilers/AVRISPMk2/[here]
* From "File -> load HEX file" choose the latest HEX and click "RUN" in the "Operations Flow" section
* Disconnect the AVR-ISP-MK2 from the USB and connect it again

Now youâ€™re ready to upload your first program to an ATTINY10.


*USBtinyISP Setup:*

* From Zadig select USBtinyISP in the device list.

* Select the target driver libusb-win32 and click (Install / Replace Driver) button.

* After the installation, open Windows Device Manager and verify the driver installation.

* Close ZADIG
